# vanda-api
Various interfaces for working with the V &amp; A (Victoria and Albert Museum) version 2 API.

- a simple versions just to show the basics of using the api
- a slighly more advanced version that pullsi nupto 100 items
- a genrous interface style timeline version that pulls in upto 2000 items per search.

Issue:
- Need to explore how to pull in all items without search for it to be truely a generous interface.
